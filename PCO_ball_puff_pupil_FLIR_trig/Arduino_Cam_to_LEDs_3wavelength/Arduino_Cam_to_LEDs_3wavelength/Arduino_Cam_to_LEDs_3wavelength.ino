//        Purpose:        Drive camera exposure states and dual LED lighting states given input counter and (modification) switch between ttl pulses 
//                        originating from a NI BNC 2059 and a BK Precision 4017a Frequency Generator so that lights are flashing between
//                        trials and subject is not informed about when stimuli will probably occur.

int inp_source = 3; //Waveform Generator input for times between trials
int trial_on = 5; //Input from BNC 2059 to indicate when labview code is running

//state variables -- could possibly rework code to work purely on reading the physical HI or LO states of pins, but easier to understand and work with by modifying state variables
